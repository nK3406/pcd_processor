In this project, I took part in a research project to determine the physical properties of underwater objects such as volume and shape. The goal of the project was to detect these features without using stereo vision technologies underwater. For this, I conducted research in two different branches on the use of traditional methods and artificial intelligence. Since I couldn't get the results I wanted in artificial intelligence, we have come to a situation where we can get approximate results with traditional methods (libraries such as open3d) that give fast and near-precise results. In general, we used Python, ZED Sdk, OpenCV, Open3D, and various machine learning methods in the project.
